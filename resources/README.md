Steps to setup the web application [REQUIRED]
----
Requirements: node (npm), postgres, linux, git


1. Ensure node is installed. Locally is preferable, to ensure proper verisons. TODO - add checks for this inside scripts.


    ./install_node.sh


2. Ensure postgres is installed. This is a bit more involved and hasn't been scripted. This README will loosely guide the steps.

    On your linux box, run the equivalent packagement tools to install at least the latest version of git and recently modern version of postgres, say 9.X for these scripts.

    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install postgresql

    With that last command, on my linux machine, I installed postgres v9.1.  For the necessary changes made post-install, following the instructions here:
    https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/postgresql.html
    Note: I have documented my steps as best as possible here, but you should read the PostgreSQL admin guide if you want more in-depth information that is out of scope for this README. This is by no means a complete setup to secure everything.

3. Modify postgresq.conf:


    sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf

    On my version, I changed line 59 to remove the hashtag/pound sign.

    listen_addresses = 'localhost'

    Note: this should be an external IP address to allow external connections 
 

4. Modify pg_hba.conf:


    sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf 

    changed the first two non-commented lines to use 'md5' hashing:

    local   all             postgres                                md5 
    local   all             all                                     md5 

5. Changed the default postgres user password according to the instructions given in the link above.

6. Execute install_pg_helper.sh to install the roles. The password set in Step 5 is required for this step.


    ./install_pg_helper.sh

7. Git clone this repository to the desired location on the server. Change directories to that folder and run: 


    npm install
    
8. If you want, you can install the coffee script parser 'globally'.


    npm install -g coffee-script@1.6.3


9. Create the secret password files to install the schemas, in the config folder.
